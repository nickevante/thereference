## Vision

The Reference has an ambitious goal to be the **Distributed Knowledge Library** for the decentralized world.

We believe knowledge is the right of all human beings.

Access to knowledge should not be ~~**centralized**~~ but freely available to all.

We aim to capture the world's knowledge on a global distributed blockchain accessible to anyone.

[The Reference](https://www.thereference.page) is a pioneering project where you can help build the infrastructure for a decentralized human knowledge base that is freely accessible to all learners around the world.

## Contributing

The main purpose of this repository is to design, develop and evolve the infrastructure of a decentralized knowledge base, making it more transparent, immutable, inclusive and widely accessible.

Read below to learn how you can take part in making human knowledge accessible to all without need of a centralized authority.
